# estream

**E-Stream** is a NAL-based empirical reasoning system in which **experience** is represented as a stream of perceived **events** and invoked actions, from which hypotheses accumulate **evidence** to guide reasoning, planning, and decision-making under uncertainty. 

E-Stream is written in MeTTa and executed efficiently using the PeTTa compiler.
